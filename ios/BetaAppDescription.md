# EMF Scope - TestFlight Beta Description

## What to Test

EMF Scope transforms your iPhone into a vintage-style electromagnetic field detector. We'd love your feedback on this beta version before our App Store launch.

## Key Features to Try

- Move your device near electronics, magnets, or appliances to see the EMF readings
- Tap the ZERO button to calibrate the meter
- Toggle the SOUND switch for Geiger counter-style audio feedback
- Try different units in Settings (µT, mG, G)
- Test light and dark themes

## Feedback We're Looking For

- Does the analog meter feel responsive and realistic?
- Are the readings stable or too jittery?
- Any UI elements that are hard to see or use?
- VoiceOver accessibility - does it announce readings clearly?
- Any crashes or unexpected behavior?

## Known Issues

- Readings vary between device models due to different magnetometer sensors
- The meter shows Earth's background magnetic field (~25-65 µT) as a baseline

## Note

This app is for educational and entertainment purposes. It uses your device's built-in magnetometer sensor and is not a certified measurement instrument.

Thank you for testing!
